# Airline_System_Project

## Description
For Airlines, I've created a desktop programme that can add flights, passengers, and tickets for people. For constructing the application, I utilised MS SQL Server and.Net.I created the software to be installed on the device used by the person who books the tickets after obtaining the traveler's information. I used the form window for the entirety of my application,.

## Features 
The Application opens with the login screen.
Home page contains four buttons.
<ul>
<li><b>Add Flight:</b><p>Helps to add and view flight details. You can also update th flight detailsusing flight code.</p></li>
<li><b>Add Passenger:</b><p> Helps to add and view passenger details. This contains an update feature where passenger details can be updated.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Ticket:</b><p>Helps to book and show the booked tickets.</p></li>
<li><b>Cancellation:</b><p>Helps with the cancellation of tickets.</p></li>
</ul>
