# Airline_System_Project

For airlines, I've created a desktop programme that can add flights, passengers, and tickets for people. For constructing the application, I utilised MS SQL Server and.Net.I created the software to be installed on the device used by the person who books the tickets after obtaining the traveler's information. For the entirety of my application, I used the form window.
